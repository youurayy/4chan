# 4chan picture downloader

## Usage

Install Node.js if you don't have it yet. Then from the command line:
	
	[sudo] npm install 4chan -g

Then proceed as follows:
	
	mkdir directory
	cd directory
	4chan http://boards.4chan.org/o/res/6487606

When the downloading finishes, the tool will keep monitoring the thread for new pictures, and download them as they appear, until the thread is removed. Press `Ctrl+C` to quit the tool. Use the option `-s` (`--single-shot`) to prevent this behavior and only donwload the existing images.

Call the program with the `--help` option to see more options, like filtering based on image dimensions, gif/non-gif format, and categorization of images into landscape and portrait subdirectories for easier mobile viewing.

## Warning

4chan is an anonymous board and from time to time, on some of its forums (e.g. `/b/`), users upload illegal content, downloading of which may implicate you in a criminal investigation. Moderators of 4chan are promptly deleting such content from the forum, but when you download images in bulk, it may happen that this illegal content ends up on your harddrive.
When the 4chan downloader tool, while checking for thread updates, registers that an image was deleted from the thread, it will attempt to delete it from your harddrive. This will of course not happen if you quit the tool prematurely using Ctrl+C.
On the unsafe forums, the safest way is to inspect the thread before you run the downloading tool, and only running the tool with the one-shot switch (`-s`).
